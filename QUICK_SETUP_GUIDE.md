# Quick Setup Guide - PPMP Database Update

## What Was Done ‚úÖ

I've successfully updated your database structure to support the revamped PR system with PPMP items. Here's what changed:

### Files Modified:
1. **New Migration**: `database/migrations/2025_10_20_060831_update_purchase_request_items_for_ppmp_system.php`
   - Converts `item_category` from rigid enum to flexible string field
   - Allows storing actual PPMP categories (e.g., "ALCOHOL OR ACETONE BASED ANTISEPTICS")

2. **Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/PurchaseRequestController.php`
   - Now saves `item_code` from PPMP items
   - Automatically stores PPMP category names
   - Validates and processes PPMP item references

3. **View**: `resources/views/purchase_requests/create.blade.php`
   - Form now sends `item_code` along with other item data

## How to Apply the Changes üöÄ

### Step 1: Start Your Database Server

**Option A - Using MySQL (XAMPP):**
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Start the MySQL service
3. Wait until it shows "Running"

**Option B - Using SQLite (No server needed):**
1. Edit your `.env` file
2. Set: `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`
3. The database file already exists at `database/database.sqlite`

### Step 2: Run the Migration

Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO  Running migrations.

2025_10_20_060831_update_purchase_request_items_for_ppmp_system .... DONE
```

### Step 3: Verify the Migration

Check the migration status:

```bash
php artisan migrate:status
```

Look for your new migration in the list - it should show "Ran".

### Step 4: Test the System

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/purchase-requests/create`

3. Test the following:
   - ‚úÖ Browse PPMP items by category
   - ‚úÖ Add items with fixed prices
   - ‚úÖ Add items with custom prices (Software, Part 2 items)
   - ‚úÖ Submit a test PR
   - ‚úÖ Check that items are saved correctly

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Issue: "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No connection could be made"

**Solution**: Your MySQL server is not running.
- Option 1: Start XAMPP MySQL service
- Option 2: Switch to SQLite in `.env`:
  ```
  DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
  DB_DATABASE=C:\xampp\htdocs\CapstoneLatest\database\database.sqlite
  ```

### Issue: "Migration table not found"

**Solution**: Initialize migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate:install
php artisan migrate
```

### Issue: "Column already exists: ppmp_item_id"

**Solution**: The column was added in a previous migration. This is expected and safe. The new migration will skip this step.

### Issue: Migration fails on rollback

**Solution**: This migration uses a temporary column strategy that's safe for both MySQL and SQLite. If you need to rollback:
```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
```

## What's New in the System üéâ

### PPMP Integration Features:

1. **Catalog-Based Selection**
   - Browse items organized by official PS-DBM PPMP categories
   - Search functionality across all items
   - Visual indicators for custom-price items

2. **Flexible Pricing**
   - Fixed prices for standard items
   - Custom pricing for Software and Part 2 items
   - Budget tracking in real-time

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Direct link to PPMP items via `ppmp_item_id`
   - Item codes automatically saved
   - Categories preserved from PPMP catalog

4. **Smart Categories**
   - No more forcing PPMP items into predefined categories
   - System stores actual PPMP category names
   - Better reporting and tracking

## Database Structure Changes üìä

### Before:
```
item_category: enum('office_supplies', 'equipment', ...)
```
- Limited to 9 predefined values
- Couldn't represent PPMP categories accurately

### After:
```
item_category: varchar(255) nullable
```
- Can store any PPMP category name
- Examples: "ALCOHOL OR ACETONE BASED ANTISEPTICS", "SOFTWARE"
- Nullable for flexibility

## Need Help? üí¨

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the detailed documentation: `DATABASE_PPMP_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`
2. Verify your database connection in `.env`
3. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. Run: `php artisan migrate:status` to see migration state

## Next Steps üìù

After successful migration:

1. ‚úÖ Test PR creation with various PPMP items
2. ‚úÖ Verify budget calculations are correct
3. ‚úÖ Check that item codes are being saved
4. ‚úÖ Ensure categories display properly in reports
5. ‚úÖ Test with both standard and custom-price items

---

**Summary**: Your database is now ready to support the full PPMP-integrated PR system! The changes are backward compatible and will work with existing data.
